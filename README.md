# Notes
The layout of the Github has been updated to represent two major branches of the Notes++ script
## Notes++
Allows fine control of the position and formatting of user-defined blocks of text within the context. Includes advanced features for timed and delayed notes, as well as input and output overrides.
## Stats++
Using Notes++ as a codebase, Stats++ adds additional features for setting up character sheets with RPG-style stats (SFW and NSFW stats are included). Also allows user-defined triggers to add stat experience and progress stats.
