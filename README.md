# Notes++
This script allows you to create notes and specify a format and locaiton for each. You can make the notes anywhere (input text, memory, author's note, WI). The notes get removed from their original location, then reformatted and reinserted into the context, according to your specifications.

## How to Create a Note
Notes can be placed anywhere, but always follow a specific pattern.
Notes must be enclosed with curly brackets `{ }`
The the first part of a note inside the brackets is a format code. The currently avaialbe codes are `an` (author's note formatting)
